Last week Nationwide Building Society achieved something significant. After nearly a year of regulatory delays we finally went live our new website: https://lnkd.in/dZH-sKm 
 
Now, you might be thinking clean / modern / concise, and our creatives did a fantastic job of that, but there is more to this story than a redesign. The technology and approach are all new - a series of firsts:
 
·     Nationwide's first platinum service in the cloud
·     Nationwide’s first cloud native deployment on 
hashtag
#microsoft 
hashtag
#azure, built with Enterprise hub/spoke landing zones https://lnkd.in/dKRN2wt
·     Nationwide’s first GraphQL API
·     Nationwide’s first Sitecore headless CMS, utilising our 
hashtag
#react in-house design system and 
hashtag
#sitecorejss
·     Nationwide’s first statically generated 
hashtag
#jamstack website built with 
hashtag
#nextjs and with some help from our friends over at Uniform 
 
This was achieved with a predominantly permanent team that went on a journey to the cloud and Kubernetes over the last few years. Not only was the tech stack new but our ways of working changed significantly. We went through an agile and devops transformation and have come out the other side as a beautifully automated, well-oiled machine that can now claim a route to live of an hour! 

Hats off to all involved, you are all amazing!
