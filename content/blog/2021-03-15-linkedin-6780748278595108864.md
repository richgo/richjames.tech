This is a must read for software engineering leaders and people managers: https://lnkd.in/dESRqtn

Some interesting takeways: 

Output is up (i.e. no. of pull requests). That includes a 25% increase in coding by managers and people leaders. Perhaps we've all retreated to our former comfort zone?

30% people feel more productive whilst 36% feel less productive. This is subjective and does not align with the data, which actually shows engineers have been more productive (likely due to lack of distractions). 

We have been creating more digital services and faster than ever before during the pandemic. The knock on is that we all seem to be burning out, so something has to change. A good reminder to reflect, make adjustments to team ways of working, and above all: look out for each other.
